  <h1> Maddie Weinstein </h1>
  
</p><p> I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Mathematics and Computer Science at University of Puget Sound.

</p><p> I received my PhD from UC Berkeley in 2021, where my advisor was Bernd Sturmfels. My dissertation,  <a href="https://math.stanford.edu/~mweinste/dissertation.pdf"> Metric Algebraic Geometry</a>, was awarded the Friedman Memorial Prize. During Summer 2021, I was a UC President's Postdoctoral Fellow at University of California San Diego. From Fall 2021 to Summer 2023, I was an NSF postdoc supervised by Ravi Vakil at Stanford University. 


 </p><p> My current research interests include applied algebraic geometry, distance optimization, the geometry of data, topological data analysis, algebraic statistics, and real algebraic geometry. 

     <p> I am honored to serve alongside these <a href="https://www.ifthenshecan.org/ambassadors"> STEM role models</a> as an American Association for the Advancement of Science IF/THEN Ambassador. Check out this <a href="https://www.ifthencollection.org"> collection</a> for profiles of amazing women in STEM. 
       
  </p><p> Here is my <a href="WeinsteinCVJan162023.pdf">CV</a>, updated January 2023.

 <h3> Outreach </h3>

  <p> I am an American Association for the Advancement of Science IF/THEN Ambassador. In this <a href="https://www.ifthenshecan.org/ambassadors/"> program</a>, I use various media platforms to inspire middle school girls to pursue STEM careers. I have enjoyed being a virtual guest speaker in several K-12 classrooms, reaching approximately 966 students as estimated by <a href="https://www.nepris.com/home/v4"> Nepris</a>. I am excited to be part of the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20200211005262/en/"> largest collection of statues of women</a>.
  <p>

  <p>As part of my application to the IF/THEN Ambassador program, I created a  <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nG_Veme7bqw">
video</a> in which I tried to give kids a sense of math research by explaining Topological Data Analysis. Thanks to Ozde Bayer for the videography! 
    <p>

  <p>
    <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~brandtm/">
Madeline Brandt</a> and I made a video called  MatheMaddie's Ice Cream Map, which you can view <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YxMsVByhk34">  here</a>. This video attempts to describe the ideas of the papers Voronoi Cells of Varieties and Voronoi Cells in Metric Algebraic Geometry of Plane Curves  (listed above in "Research") to a general audience. We received an Honorable Mention in  the NSF We Are Mathematics video competition.  <p>

<p> For two years, Madeline Brandt and I ran Gender Equity in
Mathematical Studies at UC Berkeley. We founded this group with a
grant from the Institute for Advanced Study Women and Mathematics
program and Lisa Simonyi as part of the <a href="https://www.math.ias.edu/wam/about/ambassador"> Women and Mathematics
Ambassadorship Program</a>. Activities included a reading group
to discuss articles on gender diversity in STEM, volunteering as math tutors at Willard Middle School in
Berkeley, and events to support
undergraduate math majors at Berkeley.
